### Hardware
+ Hardware are the **physical components** which make up the computer system.  
+ The **CPU** is the 'brain' of the computer. It is the device that carries out calculations to complete software instructions.
+ The **motherboard** is circuit board which is connects to main components of the computer system.
+ Any data or instructions that are to be processed by the CPU must be placed into main **memory**.
+ A **graphics card** is a device that attaches to the motherboard to enable the computer to process and display graphics.
+ A **sound** card is a device that attaches to the motherboard to enable the computer to input, process, and deliver sound
+ A **hard disk drive** is a hardware device that's used to store information like software and files. The capacity of hard drive ranges from GB to Tera Bytes.
+ A **network card provides** the computer with a network (internet connection) either through wireless signals or a physical cable connection.
+ The **power supply** is connected to main power sources to give power to the computer system. The power supply connects to all the main components of the computer system including the motherboard, hard drive, optical drives etc.
+ Input Hardware Devices
    + Mouse 
    + Keyboard
    + Microphone

+ Output Hardware Devices
    + Monitor
    + Speakers
    + Printers
+ External Storage Devices
    + External Hard drive<br>

### Hardware
+ Software is a **collection of instructions** that can be ‘run’ on a computer. These
instructions tell the computer what to do. 
+ Software is **not a physical thing** (but it can of course be stored on a physical medium
such as a CD-ROM), it is just a bunch of codes.
+ For a computer system to be **useful** it has to consist of **both hardware and software.**
+ Application Software
    + Word processor
    + Spreadsheet
    + Databases
+ System Software
    + Operating Systems
    + Device drives
    + Utilities(antivirus)
+ System software Examples
    + Operating Systems
        + Manages computers functions including hardware devices(input/output). Also provides users with a GUI interface
    + Device Drives
        + Allows hardware devices to run on the computer including printers, sound, graphics and network cards.
    + Utilities
        + Help to manage and maintain computer resources and performance by running specific tasks.
    + Linkers
        + Combines object files produced by a complier into a A single program.
    + Compiler
        + Translates a program written in a specific language which can be understood by the computer.

+ The CPU is the **'brain'** of the computer.  
+ It is where all the searching, sorting, calculating and decision making takes place.  
+ The speed of the CPU is measured in Gigahertz(GHz).
+ A 1 GHz CPU can carry out 1 billion instructions per second!  
+ Intel and AMD are the most popular CPU brands.  

##### Work of memory
1. Applications are installed in the **Secondary Storage (Hard drive).**
2. Temporary data from Applications in use are held in the **Main Memory.**
3. The CPU will **first check the Cache** for the **required piece of the data so that it can be processed.**
4. If the data is not in the cache then the **CPU will check the RAM** and **transfer data to the CPU.**
5. The Cache will then **transfer the next piece of data from the RAM into Cache.**
6. The CPU will again check the Cache for the next piece of data. **This time the CPU will be able to get the data from the Cache Memory.**

+ **Cache is the fastest type of Memory.**
+ It is located between the **processor** and the **RAM.**
+ Cache collects **data from the RAM.**
+ Holds onto **commonly used data.**
+ The Cache will **automatically transfer the next set of data from the RAM in to the Cache** so that it can be **processed by the CPU.**
<br>
<br>
+ **RAM** stands for Random Access Memory
+ **RAM** is the part of the computer that temporarily stores the instructions that the computer is running whilst the data is being processed by the **CPU.**
+ **RAM** is volatile which means that when the computer is **turned off all data is lost.**
<br>
<br>
+ **ROM** stands for **Read Only Memory**
+ ROM is a built in memory that **can not be changed (Read Only).**
+ ROM normally holds the **‘boot up’** instructions to start the computer – without it the computer wouldn’t know what to do when on button is switched on (e.g. the operating system will not start).
+ ROM is **non-volatile** memory which means that memory is **not lost when computer is turned off.**
<br>
<br>
+ The general name for these extra devices is **‘peripheral devices’.** They are usually categorised into input devices, output devices and storage devices.
+ An **input device** is a device that can **pass date into the computer**
+ Devices that **take data from the computer** are known as **output devices.**
+ **Backing storage** is also known as **secondary storage**
+ **Backing storage** is non-volatile which means that data is not lost when computer is turned off.
+ Backing storage is used to store data for a long time(data can be read from and written to)
+ Users tend to **make copies of original files** on backing storage.

## <span style="color:green"> Lecture 1.3 Operating Systems
+ An operating system is **a system software** that **manages** the general operation of a computer system:
    + Provides **security** and prevents unauthorised access to a system
    + Allows users to load, run and store **applications**. Also resolve errors occurring applications
    + Decided what should be loaded and deleted from **memory**
    + Manages **input, output and backing devices.**
    + Helping **save, organise, find and delete files**
    + Helps the user interact with the computer through **a user interface.**
<br>
<br>
+ **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** is an user interface built around graphics.
    + **Windows** – areas for displaying information
    + **Icons** - small images used to represent files/folders or applications
    + **Menus** - lists of options or applications users can select from
    + **Pointers** – Mouse pointer can be used to select and open files/applications
+ GUIs are quite easy to use due to the visual nature of the interfac
+ The user has lots of visual clues as to what things do
+ WIMP - acronym for **Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers**. a set of software features and hardware devices (such as windows, icons, mice, and pull-down menus) designed to simplify or demystify computing operations for the user.
<br>
<br>
+ CLI requires the user to enter command prompts to interact with the computer.
+ CLI are normally used by expert users as it allows them to is more complicated to use.
+ CLI and is not restricted to a number of predetermined options.
+ Example Command Prompts
    + ATTRIB: Displays or changes file attributes.
    + CD: Displays the name of current directory
    + CHKDSK: Checks a disk and displays a status report
    + Copy: Copies one or more files to another location
    + DIR: Displays a list of files and sub directories

+ **Storage medium** is the name given to the device that actually <u>**holds the data**</u>.
+ Sometimes the **storage medium** is **fixed** i.e. magnetic coated disks build into hard drive.
+ Sometimes the **storage medium** is **removable** from the device i.e. CD ROM that can be taken out of the drive.
+ Think about what we store:
    + Documents, Images, Video, Music, Software, Games etc.
<br>

        + Using large-capacity media such as **magnetic tape**
        + Keeping **old copies** of backups, just in case.
        + **Automating** the system so that nobody forgets to do it!
        + Keeping backup media **off-site** (in case of fire or theft)
